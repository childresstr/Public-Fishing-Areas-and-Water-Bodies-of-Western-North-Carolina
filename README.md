# Public-Fishing-Areas-and-Water-Bodies-of-Western-North-Carolina
This repository contains a web map of the public fishing areas and the majority of water bodies in the 19 western counties of North Carolina. You will find that the base map was provided by CartoDB and does an excellent job of depicting the water bodies and fishing areas against a light background. The fishing areas, as depicted by the water symbology, can be clicked to determine whether the site contains canoe access to further your fishing ventures. These fishing points were provided by the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commision, along with other entities, and reflect locations that are both free and provide 24/7 access to public water for fishing activities. The water bodies are comprised of estuaries, lakes, ponds, reservoirs, swamps, and marshes all of which are primarily in the southwestern counties of North Carolina. Both the data for the water bodies and the fishing areas were obtained from NC One Map. There is information in the legend that describes the area of the water bodies in area square kilometers which provides a better understanding of the size of water body that public fishing is allowed on. This map could be used be by anglers, scientists, and families alike.
